# Next_Product_To_Buy
Sample study: This study file demonstrates Next-Product-To-Buy modeling using a test performed on 30,000 customers.
**This study is then used on a different circumstance and larger dataset to identify the best product.**

Sample Study Details:
Offers to buy a book were sent out in one category to 10,000 randomly selected customers. Another 10,000 in second and another 10,000 got an offer in third category. The dataset contains information on responses from these 30,000 customers. The task is to use the available data to find the best book to offer each of the 30,000 customers in the test, as well as the best book to offer an additional 10,000 customers that were not part of the test. 

The study uses logistic regression with buyer as the response variable and customer characteristics and book categories as the explanatory variables. The model is modified using interactions. We want to predict what each customer would have done if we had sent him/her any one of the three offers (from 3 book categories: Art, DIY, Cook).
